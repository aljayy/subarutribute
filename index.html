        <h2 id="headline">The insane history of the WRX STI:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1993</strong> - The Impreza was debutted in Japan. Subaru offered a special package for their homeland, giving buyers the option to get their hands on a turbocharged model called the WRX. </li>
          <li><strong>1994</strong> - This became the first year the Impreza competed in every round of the World Rally Championship. And this was done with the upgraded WRX, presented as the STI. It had carbon fiber strut tower braces, better intercooler, and forged pistons.</li>
          <li><strong>1995</strong> - Subaru won the WRC title with the Impreza, being driven by Colin McRae. </li>
          <li><strong>1998</strong> - Subaru produced the STI 22B to celebrate their 40th annviersary and their third consectuvie WRC title, this model became a staple in the car community with only 424 being produced.</li>
          <li><strong>2002</strong> - The WRX was finally introduced in the states in it's beautiful bugeye model. This changed the tuner culture here in the states, and proved that there was a market for fun, 4-cyl, turbo cars in America. Nothing would ever be the same. </li>
          <li><strong>2004</strong> - This is what I believe to be the most iconic model, not only because I have one, but because this is when America also got the STI model. The EJ25 2.5 liter engine made 300hp and the turbocahrger made 14.5 pounds of boost.</li>
          <li><strong>2006</strong> - The WRX got a facelift and the Hawk Eye model was released.</li>
          <li><strong>2008</strong> - This is the year that Subaru tried to the WRX more mainstream to attract a broader audience, coming with a softer suspension and less aggressive look. Die hard fans voiced their anger clearly about this.</li>
          <li><strong>2009</strong> - After admitting they went to far to gain mainstream appeal, the WRX came with a better suspension and 265 hp.</li>
          <li><strong>2011</strong> - Cosworth got their hands on the STI and did something revoluontary. Giving it 365 ho and 380 lb feet of torque. This beast did 0-60 in 3.7 seconds. Unfortanely only 5 were produced. </li>
          <li><strong>2014</strong> - Subaru ditched the hatchback desing and opted for a sedan styled car. This car was met with mixed reviews with some saying that it was too tame for the WRX, while others said that a new look was very much needed.</li>
          <li><strong>2015</strong> - This model got a new twin scroll turbo and a 6 speed gearbox.</li>
          <li><strong>2016</strong> - Subaru set a new world record at the Isle of Man when it completed the 37 mile course in under 18 minutes.</li>
